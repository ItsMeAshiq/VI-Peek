# VI-Peek

## What Does VI Peek Do?

**VI Peek provides a different way to zoom your VIs**. From a single window, you can drill down a VI hierarchy and easily move back up the calling chain.

## How Will VI Peek Help Me?

+ During a debugging session, how many windows do you have open? 10? 100?
+ Do you have trouble remembering how to move back up teh call chain after drilling down through the VI hierarchy to lower-level VIs?

**This Is Where VI Peek Can Save You Time**

+ When VI Peek is active, selecting a SubVI on any Block Diagram opens the VI Peek window.
+ When opened, it will show the selected SubVI's Block Diagram.
+ Clicking on another SubVI from wihtin the VI Peek window allows you to view that SubVI's Block Diagram.
+ Clicking Back or in the Peek Stack (hierarchy) allows you to move back up the call chain.
